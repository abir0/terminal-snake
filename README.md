Terminal Snake
==============

This is a simple TUI based snake game made with curses.

### Getting Started

In linux, curses come pre-installed with python. But in windows, windows-curses needs to be installed. 
Just run `pip install windows-curses` in cmd or powershell.

Then to execute the program, go to the folder [terminal_snake](https://github.com/abir0/terminal_snake) and run `python snake`.

Enjoy the game!
